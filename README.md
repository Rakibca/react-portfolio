## Description
This is a portfolio of my past projects using React to showcase my work to hiring managers.
Email.Js package was used for the contact form which allows us to connect to other email services through which the emails are sent. Therefore anyone can send me a message which gets sent to my inbox as an email. Finally, this React app was deployed to GitHub Pages.
